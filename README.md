** Heart Prediction System **

The image you've uploaded is a chest X-ray that appears to have characteristics consistent with a medical diagnosis related to lung or heart conditions. 

However, without additional context or professional interpretation, it is challenging to provide a conclusive diagnosis based solely on this image.

To work with such an X-ray image using tools and libraries, here's an outline of tools commonly used in machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging analysis.


## Tools & Libraries for X-ray Analysis:
Python Libraries:

* OpenCV: To handle image processing tasks such as reading, resizing, or manipulating X-ray images.

    pip install opencv-python.

* NumPy: For array manipulations and mathematical operations.

    pip install nump

* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the data and images.

    pip install matplotlib seaborn

* Scikit-learn: To handle machine learning models.

    pip install scikit-learn
